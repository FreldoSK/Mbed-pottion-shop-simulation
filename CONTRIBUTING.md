Project Objective This project has been crafted to provide hands-on experience in embedded systems programming. Its primary aim was to familiarize with programming using the Mbed API for the STM32L476 DISCO board, gaining a deeper understanding of the following concepts:

Thread synchronization (RTOS) Object-oriented programming (OOP) Interrupts Utilizing UART communication The main goal was to acquire practical insights and comprehension of these aspects within embedded systems development using the Mbed API tailored for the STM32L476 DISCO platform.
